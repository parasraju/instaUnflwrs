A secondary (bot) Instagram account for login (recommended)
Discord server with webhook access

## üîß Installation

Notes & Best Practices
Do not use your main Instagram account for automation to avoid potential bans.
The script stores followers in followers.json (created automatically).
Adjust the CHECK_INTERVAL in your .env file to avoid Instagram rate limits (30+ minutes recommended).
Keep your .env file secure and never commit it to public repositories.
